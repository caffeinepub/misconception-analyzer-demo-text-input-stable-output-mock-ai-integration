  "summary": "Frontend hook adds backend-first analysis with validated fallback disclosure logic, but the backend `analyzeExplanation` implementation itself is not shown/implemented (only a type definition is present), so the core backend requirement remains unmet based on the provided diff summary.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update the backend `analyzeExplanation` method (`backend/main.mo`) so it no longer returns fixed placeholder strings and instead produces a result derived from the caller-provided explanation text, returning exactly two fields: `misconception` and `whyFailed`, where `whyFailed` explains why the user’s mental model broke down.",
      "reason": "The diff shows only the `ExplanationAnalysis` type being defined in `backend/main.mo` and does not show any `analyzeExplanation` method implementation that derives output from the provided input text or returns the required record.",

        "backend/main.mo"
